## "Most new self-made millionaires are in software, compared to consumer services type industries in the 90s"
# need filter for selfmade_check = TRUE
# make bar chart with three areas on x axis for different points in time and % of billionaires on y axis
# bars show wealth.how.industry classification

## "This is related to different countriesâ€™ GDP, of course, with richer countries providing more innovation in consumer services"
# want to make regression
# check if countries GDP predicts % of innovation in consumer services (wealth.how.industry)
# maybe make regression on predictors of billionaires
